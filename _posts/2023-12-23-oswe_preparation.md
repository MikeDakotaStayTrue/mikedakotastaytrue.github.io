### Introduction

{:data-toc-text="Introduction"}
Start of preparation for [OSWE](https://www.offsec.com/courses/web-300/) exam from OffSec :)\
Wanna blog my progress to preparations - share links, progress, minds about and e.t.c

### Сollecting material to study
{:data-toc-text="Material"}

For first, wanted to get information about exam format, people opinion who passed, found couple of pages:
* [Как я OSWE сдавал](https://habr.com/ru/companies/pm/articles/733170/)
* [Becoming a web security expert](https://habr.com/ru/companies/angarasecurity/articles/595071/)
* [An honest OSWE 2023 review](https://charchitverma100.medium.com/an-honest-oswe-2023-review-my-journey-preparation-and-exam-67d0adcbcde4)


After, i started to search technical material to prepare exam.\
There is [google table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit#gid=665299979) with HackTheBox machines which can improve my skill for OSWE exam. IDK what these machines contain, i plan to solve and describe it later, when it be a christmas holidays. And take notes about all whitebox pentesting moments in these machines.
